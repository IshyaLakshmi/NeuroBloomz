Place the website logo image here so the site can load it locally:

- Save your PNG (the attached image) as `logo.png` in this folder.
- Final path: `assets/logo.png`

Notes:
- The header uses `<img src="assets/logo.png">` and will hide the image automatically if it fails to load.
- If you prefer an inline data-URI instead, provide the base64-encoded PNG and I can inline it into `4th draft.html` for maximum reliability (file:// viewing).
